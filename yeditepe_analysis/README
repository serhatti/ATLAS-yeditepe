Requirements : 

ROOT and pythia8 must be installed

*) ROOT and PYTHIA environment variables must be set (see our setupEnv.sh and add it to the end of your .bashrc / or manually source it)

*) anything under Analyses/pythia8-root must be main programs with file extensions .cc or .cpp

HOW to build your codes ? 

1) In order to build your user main programs put them under Analyses/pythia8-root folder
Your file extensions must either be .cc or .cpp

2) create a folder with any name you want in your computer. For example lets create a folder called "analysis-build"
   and cd there 

> mkdir analysis-build
> cd analysis-build

Then run cmake on this folder:
> cmake /path/to/folder/yeditepe-analysis

Then compile+install your codes :
> make install

then  INSTALL/bin folder is  created. There you may find your executables and run them...


**********************************************************************************************************

*) If you want your executables to be appended on system path so that you will be able to run programs on any location you want without specifying full path
 You need to do :

> source setup.sh

Then for example just :

> main01

will be an available command on any location
